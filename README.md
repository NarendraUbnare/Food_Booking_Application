# Food_Booking_Application

This assignment challenges your SQL querying proficiency by presenting a case study based on a food delivery application database, akin to platforms like Zomato. Your task is to extract specific insights by writing efficient and accurate SQL queries.

# Scenario
This section details the relational database schema for a food delivery application. The database consists of five interconnected tables: Restaurants: Holds core information about each restaurant (RestaurantID, Name, City, CuisineType, Rating, AverageCostForTwo). Customers: Stores personal and demographic details for all registered users (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Phone, City, JoinDate). Orders: Tracks every transaction, detailing customer purchases from restaurants (OrderID, CustomerID, RestaurantID, OrderDate, OrderAmount, OrderStatus). Reviews: Captures customer feedback and ratings for restaurants (ReviewID, CustomerID, RestaurantID, Rating, Comment, ReviewDate). Payments: Records all payment transactions associated with orders (PaymentID, OrderID, PaymentMethod, Amount, PaymentDate).

# Assignment Queries
Below are the ten specific SQL queries to be written, each designed to extract meaningful insights from the database, covering aspects of restaurant performance, customer behavior, and operational trends: Retrieve the names and locations of restaurants with a rating of 4.5 or higher. Find the total number of orders placed by each customer. List all restaurants offering "Italian" cuisine in "Mumbai". Calculate the total revenue generated by each restaurant from completed orders. Retrieve the most recent order placed by each customer. List customers who have not placed any orders yet. Identify the most reviewed restaurants. Find the most preferred payment method. List the top 5 restaurants by total revenue. Show the details of all cancelled orders along with the customer's and restaurant's names.
